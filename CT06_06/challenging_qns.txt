Q1.
This code is supposed to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.

total = 0
for i in range(1, 5):
    total += i
print(total)

What is wrong?
A. The loop stops too early
B. total should start from 1
C. += is incorrect
D. print is in the wrong place


Q2.
This code is supposed to add all numbers from 1 to 5.

for i in range(1, 6):
    total = 0
    total += i
print(total)

What is the main problem?
A. i should start from 0
 

B. range(1, 6) is incorrect
C. total is reset every loop
D. print should be inside the loop


Q3.
This code is supposed to add all numbers from 0 to 4 into total.

total = 0
for i in range(5):
    i += total
print(total)

Why does total stay 0?
A. total is never updated
B. the loop does not run
C. range(5) is wrong
D. i cannot change


Q4.
This code is supposed to find the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 9.

total = 0
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    total += 2
print(total)

What is the mistake?
A. The wrong value is added
B. The range is incorrect
C. total should start from 1
D. The step size is wrong


Q5.
This code is supposed to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.

total = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    total += 1
print(total)

What is the code actually doing?
A. Counting how many times the loop runs
B. Adding numbers from 1 to 5
C. Adding only the last number
D. Nothing


Q6.
This code is supposed to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.

total = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    total = i
print(total)

Why is the answer wrong?
A. total is overwritten each loop
B. range(1, 6) is incorrect
C. i should start from 0
D. print should be inside the loop
 
DEBUGGING PRACTICE – FOR LOOPS

Read each question carefully.
The code is supposed to give a specific output, but something is wrong.
Edit the code so it works correctly.


Q1. (Multiple Errors: syntax / name / type)
This code is supposed to print the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 (15).

total = "0"
for i in range(1, 6)
    totl += i
print(total)


Q2. (Logic Error – reset inside loop)
This code is supposed to print the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 (15).

for i in range(1, 6):
    total = 0
    total += i
print(total)


Q3. (Logic Error – counting instead of summing)
This code is supposed to print the sum of even numbers from 2 to 10 (30).

total = 0
for i in range(2, 11, 2):
    total += 1
print(total)


Q4. (Logic Error – off-by-one range)
This code is supposed to print the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 (55).

total = 0
for i in range(1, 10):
    total += i
print(total)


Q5. (Logic Error – wrong accumulation value)
This code is supposed to print the sum of numbers from 3 to 7 (25).

total = 0
for i in range(3, 8):
    total = total + 3
print(total)


Q6. (Logic Error – wrong step size)
This code is supposed to print the sum of even numbers from 2 to 20 (110).

total = 0
for i in range(2, 21, 1):
    total += i
print(total)


Q7. (Logic Error – end value missing)
This code is supposed to print the sum of multiples of 3 from 3 to 30 (165).

total = 0
for i in range(3, 30, 3):
    total += i
print(total)


Q8. (Logic Error – adding the wrong variable)
This code is supposed to print the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
If n = 6, it should print 21.

n = 6
total = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    total += n
print(total)


Q9. (Logic Error – two totals mixed up)
This code is supposed to print:
• the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 (15)
• the sum of numbers from 6 to 10 (40)

total1 = 0
total2 = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    total2 += i

for i in range(6, 11):
    total1 += i

print(total1, total2)


Q10. (Logic Error – misunderstanding loop range)
This code is supposed to print the sum of numbers from 10 to 1
(10 + 9 + 8 + ... + 1 = 55).

total = 0
for i in range(10, 0):
    total += i
print(total)
