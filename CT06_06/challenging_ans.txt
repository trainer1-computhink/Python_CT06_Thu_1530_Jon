Q1
Correct answer: A
Explanation:
range(1, 5) counts 1, 2, 3, 4.
The number 5 is not included, so the sum is missing the last number.
That’s why the loop stops too early.

Q2
Correct answer: C
Explanation:
total = 0 is inside the loop, so it resets back to 0 every round.
The total never gets a chance to grow.
________________________________________
Q3
Correct answer: A
Explanation:
The code changes i, but total is never updated.
Since total never changes, it stays 0.

Q4
Correct answer: A
Explanation:
The loop is correct, but the code adds 2 every time instead of adding i.
It should add the number from the loop, not a fixed value.
________________________________________
Q5
Correct answer: A
Explanation:
total += 1 adds 1 each loop, not the value of i.
So the code is counting how many times the loop runs, not summing numbers.

Q6
Correct answer: A
Explanation:
total = i replaces the value of total each loop.
At the end, total only keeps the last value of i, not the sum.

Q1. (Multiple Errors: syntax / name / type)
Fixed code:
total = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    total += i
print(total)

Fixes needed:
- Change total from string to integer
- Add missing colon after for loop
- Fix variable name totl → total


Q2. (Logic Error – reset inside loop)
Fixed code:
total = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    total += i
print(total)

Fix:
- Remove resetting total = 0 inside the loop


Q3. (Logic Error – counting instead of summing)
Fixed code:
total = 0
for i in range(2, 11, 2):
    total += i
print(total)

Fix:
- Add i instead of 1 (summing values, not counting loops)


Q4. (Logic Error – off-by-one range)
Fixed code:
total = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    total += i
print(total)

Fix:
- Change range end from 10 to 11 so 10 is included


Q5. (Logic Error – wrong accumulation value)
Fixed code:
total = 0
for i in range(3, 8):
    total += i
print(total)

Fix:
- Add i, not a fixed value (3)


Q6. (Logic Error – wrong step size)
Fixed code:
total = 0
for i in range(2, 21, 2):
    total += i
print(total)

Fix:
- Change step size from 1 to 2 so only even numbers are added


Q7. (Logic Error – end value missing)
Fixed code:
total = 0
for i in range(3, 31, 3):
    total += i
print(total)

Fix:
- Change range end to 31 so 30 is included


Q8. (Logic Error – adding the wrong variable)
Fixed code:
n = 6
total = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    total += i
print(total)

Fix:
- Add i instead of n


Q9. (Logic Error – two totals mixed up)
Fixed code:
total1 = 0
total2 = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    total1 += i

for i in range(6, 11):
    total2 += i

print(total1, total2)

Fix:
- Accumulate values into the correct variables


Q10. (Logic Error – misunderstanding loop range)
Fixed code:
total = 0
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    total += i
print(total)

Fix:
- Add a negative step so the loop counts down
